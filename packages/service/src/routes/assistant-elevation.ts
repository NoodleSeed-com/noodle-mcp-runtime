/**
 * Turning "you cannot do that" into "sign in and I will" (ADR 0201, 5.6b).
 *
 * On a `mixed` surface an identity-dependent capability is projected to anonymous visitors on purpose:
 * the model should be able to *offer* it, because offering is how the visitor learns signing in is worth
 * doing. What must never happen is the call proceeding — so the interception sits after authorization
 * and before dispatch, and returns an elevation request instead of a result.
 *
 * The sign-in ticket goes to the browser. That is safe only because spending one also requires the
 * customer's client credentials and a tenant match, both enforced where it is claimed; on its own it
 * names a conversation and nothing more. It is named `signInTicket` on the wire precisely because the
 * runtime's server-held interaction `continuation` has the opposite property — that one must never
 * reach browser code — and one word must not carry both contracts.
