# Self-host Noodle Core

**Owns:** The supported source-built Docker Compose path for a local Noodle Core service.
**Read when:** Running, operating, or evaluating Noodle Core on your own machine.
**Do not put here:** Noodle Seed Cloud operations or private infrastructure procedures.
**Update when:** The generated files, Compose topology, supported self-host capabilities, or operator steps change.

Noodle Core's first supported self-host profile is a single-machine, single-operator beta. It runs from the
source in this repository and does not require a Noodle Seed account, license key, or managed service.

## Prerequisites

- macOS, Linux, or WSL2
- Docker with the `docker compose` v2 command
- Node.js 24 or newer to run the published CLI
- access to npm and the container registry during the first build

Before initialization, verify that the Compose plugin is installed and the Docker daemon is available to your
current shell:

```sh
docker compose version
docker info
```

On Fedora, follow Docker's [official Fedora installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/).
For native Linux permissions and daemon setup, follow Docker's
[Linux post-install guidance](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/). After adding your user
to the `docker` group, refresh the session with a full logout/login or the documented `newgrp docker` method,
then rerun both checks. Membership in the `docker` group grants root-equivalent privileges; use it only on a
machine and daemon you trust. Do not make the Docker socket world-writable or disable SELinux or a firewall as a
blanket workaround.

If a check fails, use its symptom before changing Noodle configuration:

- `docker: command not found` means the Docker CLI is missing.
- `docker: unknown command: docker compose` means the Compose plugin is missing. An `unknown flag: --build`
  error from the startup line can be the same incomplete installation rather than an invalid Compose option.
- A daemon connection error means Docker Engine is stopped or unreachable; follow the platform installation
  guide to start it, then rerun `docker info`.
- `permission denied` for the Docker socket means the current shell lacks access. Follow the Linux post-install
  guide and refresh the login session; do not weaken the socket permissions.

The published `@noodleseed/one` package contains the initializer. Anyone with a compatible Noodle Core
checkout can run it globally, through `npx`, or from an existing local installation. Before writing anything,
the command checks this checkout's `noodleCore.composeInitVersion` marker. An incompatible CLI fails without
creating `.self-host/` and tells you to use a matching pinned CLI version.

The complete environment and secret classification lives in [configuration](configuration.md). The generated
values are sufficient for the public first-deploy path; optional owner authentication is never enabled silently.

## Start the stack

From a fresh clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NoodleSeed-com/noodle-core.git
cd noodle-core
npx @noodleseed/one@latest service init --profile open-core --compose
docker compose up --build --wait postgres noodle && docker compose run --build --rm bootstrap
```

The first command creates protected local state. The second line builds the service and CLI from this exact
checkout, starts PostgreSQL and Noodle, waits for both health boundaries, and then creates the `noodle-local`
organization through the normal CLI/API path. Running both commands again is safe: generated secrets remain
byte-identical and organization creation is idempotent.

Noodle listens only on `http://127.0.0.1:8787`. PostgreSQL has no host port.

## What initialization creates

| Path | Mode | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `.self-host/` | `0700` | Ignored operator state. |
| `.self-host/.env` | `0600` | Canonical operator environment with random PostgreSQL, encryption, administrator, and asset-identity secrets plus optional portable OAuth settings. |
| `.self-host/.env.postgres` | `0600` | Generated PostgreSQL-only environment; do not edit or back it up separately. |
| `.self-host/.env.noodle` | `0600` | Generated Noodle-service environment; do not edit or back it up separately. |
| `.self-host/.env.operator` | `0600` | Generated bootstrap/CLI administrator environment; do not edit or back it up separately. |
| `.self-host/compose.generated.yaml` | `0644` | Generated PostgreSQL, Noodle, and bootstrap topology; it contains no secret values. |
| `noodle.service.yaml` | `0644` | The selected `open-core` service profile. |

The tracked `compose.yaml` includes the generated fragment. Writes are atomic, symlink targets are rejected,
and command output contains paths and next steps—not secret values or the rendered database URL.

Initialization always derives the three service-specific environment files from canonical `.self-host/.env`,
so ambient shell variables cannot replace the generated stack credentials and each container receives only
the values it needs. Edit only canonical `.self-host/.env`, then rerun the initialization command to reconcile
the derived files. `--force` replaces changed non-secret templates but never rotates `.self-host/.env`. Do not use
`--replace-secrets` on a stack with data you need: it rotates every generated secret, including the key that
protects persisted configuration. For a disposable reset, stop the stack, remove its volumes and `.self-host/`,
then initialize again.

## What runs

| Service | Role | Persistent state |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `postgres` | Control-plane, deployment, configuration, and audit durability. | `postgres-data` named volume |
| `noodle` | Dual-era Streamable HTTP MCP service and deployment API. | `asset-data` named volume plus PostgreSQL |
| `bootstrap` | Short-lived CLI container that idempotently creates the `noodle-local` organization. | None |
| `cli` | Opt-in operator CLI used with `docker compose run --build --rm cli …`; it carries the local administrator credential only inside Compose. | Ephemeral bounded `.noodle` state for the one command |

All containers run as non-root with a read-only root filesystem, dropped Linux capabilities,
`no-new-privileges`, and bounded temporary filesystems. Noodle can write only to `/tmp` and its named asset
volume. Both application images are built from the same repository revision; this beta does not pull a
separately versioned Noodle image. Installation and runtime packaging preserve the checked-in dependency
lockfile, including peer dependencies, so a later registry publication cannot silently change the packaged
React and React DOM pair.

## Deploy and call an app

The default Compose profile deliberately has no end-user identity provider. Use `--access public` for a first
local deployment. The CLI image contains the curated examples from the same source revision, so deployment does
not require a host Node.js install or exposing the administrator token to the host shell:

```sh
docker compose run --build --rm cli deploy /app/examples/hello/src/server.ts \
  --org noodle-local --app hello --env prod --access public
```

The deploy command prints the MCP endpoint. The administrator token is valid only for control-plane operations;
it is not accepted as an end-user MCP bearer token. The `cli` service is under the `tools` Compose profile, so it
does not become a long-running container during normal startup; explicitly targeting it with `compose run` enables
it for that one command.

In [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector), choose Streamable HTTP, paste the
printed endpoint, connect, list the available tools, and invoke `greet` with `{"name":"Ada"}`. The result includes
`Hello, Ada!`. The endpoint is an MCP transport, not a dashboard URL, and this first public Hello deployment does
not need an end-user bearer token. The administrator bearer remains invalid on the data plane. Noodle Core
includes no managed account or web Console.

### Use Noodle Seed Cloud and Noodle Core side by side

The published `@noodleseed/one` package supplies the `noodle` command for both products; there is no separate
Core executable. Keep an installed host command signed in to Noodle Seed Cloud, and run Core operator commands
through Compose. The host command keeps using its saved Cloud service and login:

```sh
noodle status --org acme --app hosted-app --env prod
```

Host `noodle dev` starts a separate local development runtime for the source on your host; it does not deploy to
the PostgreSQL-backed Compose service. Use the Compose CLI `deploy` command above when you want the app served by
the self-hosted stack. Containerized development profiles, source mounts, and host-network workarounds are not
part of this supported startup path.

Core commands use the service URL and administrator credential isolated inside Compose:

```sh
docker compose run --build --rm cli status \
  --org noodle-local --app hello --env prod
docker compose run --build --rm cli smoke \
  --org noodle-local --app hello --env prod
docker compose logs --follow noodle
```

This also guarantees that Core operations use the CLI built from the same checkout as the running service. Avoid
pointing the host command at Core with only `--service`: CLI settings resolve as flag, then environment, then saved
configuration, so a saved Cloud credential could otherwise be selected with the local service URL. The Compose
command supplies the local service and its administrator credential as one isolated pair without exposing the
credential to the host shell.

Run client-connection commands on the host because they update that host's MCP-client configuration. This does not
change the CLI's saved Cloud target:

```sh
npx @noodleseed/one@latest connect claude-code \
  --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8787/o/noodle-local/hello/v1/mcp
```

Noodle Core has no web dashboard or managed Console. Operate deployments with the Compose CLI commands above and
open the printed MCP endpoint only from an MCP client. Noodle Seed Cloud deployments continue to print and support
their project dashboard URL.

For an `owner-only` deployment, configure either an external OAuth issuer and JWKS URL or the complete portable
Google-federated OAuth group in `.self-host/.env`, rerun initialization to update `.env.noodle`, recreate the Noodle container, and bind the intended OAuth
subject with `--owner-subject`. Keep the administrator as the real deploy/audit actor. The self-host process
rejects partial OAuth configuration and rejects the private WorkOS platform-auth variables.

- External issuer: `NOODLE_OAUTH_ISSUER` and `NOODLE_OAUTH_JWKS_URI`.
- Google federation: `NOODLE_OAUTH_ISSUER`, `NOODLE_OAUTH_SIGNING_KEY_BASE64` (canonical base64 PKCS#8),
  `NOODLE_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `NOODLE_OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and
  `NOODLE_OAUTH_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`; `NOODLE_OAUTH_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN` is optional.

Non-loopback OAuth URLs must use HTTPS. After changing canonical `.self-host/.env`, run
`noodle service init --profile open-core --compose` and then rerun the canonical startup line so Compose
recreates the affected container.

## Restart, inspect, and reset

```sh
docker compose ps --all
docker compose logs --follow noodle
docker compose down
docker compose up --build --wait postgres noodle && docker compose run --build --rm bootstrap
```

`docker compose down` preserves the named PostgreSQL and asset volumes. Follow the
[manual backup and restore procedure](backup-and-restore.md) to capture PostgreSQL and assets together while
protecting `.self-host/.env` separately; losing the encryption key can make persisted secrets unusable.
`docker compose down --volumes` deletes the local database and packaged assets and should be used only for an
intentional reset.

## What this beta includes

- TypeScript authoring, validation, compilation, and the CLI
- deploy, preflight, status, inspection, access changes, history, and rollback through typed API/CLI paths
- tools, resources, prompts, Apps artifacts, and both supported MCP protocol eras
- PostgreSQL deployment/configuration durability and restart recovery
- encrypted local managed secrets and durable filesystem-packaged assets
- local administrator control-plane authentication
- optional external-issuer or portable Google-federated owner authentication

## What it does not include

- Noodle Seed Cloud, the managed Console, billing, subscriptions, or commercial policy modules
- WorkOS platform identity, managed KMS/key custody, Noodle Seed-hosted credential custody, or hosted signup
- hosted GitHub builds and deploy automation, cloud/edge asset delivery, or managed distribution channels
- a published production image, automatic upgrades, backups, TLS, DNS, monitoring, high availability, or support SLA
- a production security posture for public internet exposure

You own deployment and operations beyond this local reference stack. Before exposing it outside loopback, add a
TLS-terminating reverse proxy, restrict network access, configure a real `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, choose and test the
end-user OAuth boundary, test the documented backup/restore procedure for your environment, establish an upgrade
procedure, and monitor both PostgreSQL and Noodle.
The filesystem asset store is a single-host boundary. For independent managed instances, use the private GCS provider and external schema mode described below.

Read the [security boundary](security.md) and [compatibility policy](compatibility-and-upgrades.md) before going
beyond evaluation. For community help, see [SUPPORT.md](../SUPPORT.md). Report vulnerabilities through
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md), never in a public issue.


## Independent managed instances

Set `NOODLE_ASSET_STORAGE=gcs` and `NOODLE_ASSET_BUCKET` to a private bucket with uniform bucket-level access. Omit `NOODLE_ASSET_ROOT`; preserve `NOODLE_ASSET_IDENTITY_SALT` and the runtime master key across replacements. The filesystem provider remains the default and requires its root. GCS mode uses the attached Google service account through the fixed metadata server and the official GCS JSON API; JSON key files and local ADC impersonation are not supported by this adapter. Grant the running identity object read/create access on only the selected bucket (the standard `roles/storage.objectUser` role includes the required permissions). Never make this bucket public or add an object-expiration rule that deletes reachable assets.

The runtime stores immutable, validated image envelopes under `objects/` and immutable deployment reachability records under `reachability/`. It does not implement automatic garbage collection. A domain-separated HMAC upload capability binds the full trusted scope, identity, hash, MIME, dimensions, byte length and ten-minute expiry. Capabilities work on any instance; treat upload URLs as bearer capabilities and do not log them. Uploads validate bytes before atomic create-if-absent. Replay/racing writes return 409 and cannot overwrite a committed object. Deployment verification and public reads recheck envelope, byte hash and image metadata. Only image bytes are exposed at `/__noodle/hosted-assets/`; no listing, reachability or stored metadata route exists. Limits are 100 assets and 50 MiB per plan, 10 MiB per file, 16 KiB stored metadata. Provider operations have a ten-second deadline.

### Database migration and startup

For the initial external-owner-authentication profile, run a separate migration job before starting instances:

```sh
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://migration-role@database/runtime' node apps/self-host/dist/main.js migrate
```

Supply the actual migration credential through your job's secret mechanism, not shell history. This command requires only `DATABASE_URL`; it does not need the runtime master key, admin token, assets, OAuth credentials, or HTTP configuration. It constructs no HTTP listener, asset provider, background worker or integrated OAuth app. `NOODLE_BUILD_SHA`, if available, is recorded as nonsecret build evidence.

The migration role owns the runtime database/schema objects. Configure its default privileges so the application role inherits table SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE and sequence USAGE; grant schema USAGE and existing-object permissions. After the first migration, explicitly revoke INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on `public.noodle_schema_contract` from the application role and grant only SELECT on that ledger. Revoke schema CREATE and database CREATE/TEMP privileges from the application role and PUBLIC where appropriate. Do not supply the migration credential to the serving process.

The serving process sets `NOODLE_SCHEMA_MODE=external` with the application-role `DATABASE_URL`. It validates the schema marker before any workers/listener start, constructs the same PostgreSQL stores, and skips only their explicit schema initialization. The automatic audit module stays active. This profile supports no integrated Core OAuth, custom modules, application connections, custom assistant stores, or disabled business persistence; those configurations fail startup. The existing default `initialize` mode retains ordinary self-host behavior. A Unix socket host query in the PostgreSQL URL is passed through unchanged; the pool maximum remains five.

Migration execution uses one stable database advisory lock on a dedicated checked-out connection, with a ten-second lock-acquisition deadline, sixty-second statement timeout and ten-minute run deadline. Losing the lock fails the job and stops further pool work. The marker is published after the complete canonical schema list succeeds. An exact completed plan skips; an older generation refuses. Application revisions may overlap only within the declared compatible epoch/profile. The source schema fingerprint test requires an explicit generation/epoch review for schema-owner changes. Incompatible upgrades need a separate reviewed procedure; this is not an arbitrary online upgrade/rollback mechanism. Personal-workspace trigger replacement is transactional.

External mode uses lazy deployment recovery. `/readyz` follows schema validation and store construction, but it does not certify every persisted deployment has compiled successfully. Verify actual tools and widget resources after replacement. SIGTERM drains normal work, force-closes HTTP connections after five seconds, and exits with failure if shutdown exceeds eight seconds; interrupted in-flight work is not guaranteed to finish.

### Admission to a private Cloud Run policy API

Keep `NOODLE_ADMISSION_URL` and `NOODLE_ADMISSION_TOKEN` for the existing business-policy contract. Optionally set `NOODLE_ADMISSION_GOOGLE_AUDIENCE` to the exact HTTPS `*.run.app` origin of that URL, without a trailing slash. The runtime obtains an audience-bound Google ID token from the fixed metadata identity endpoint, sends it as `X-Serverless-Authorization`, and retains the business bearer in `Authorization`. Other origins, credentials in URLs, non-HTTPS audiences and redirects are rejected. The attached service account needs invocation permission on that policy service only.

`NOODLE_ADMISSION_TIMEOUT_MS` accepts integers from 1 to 10000, default 2000. One deadline covers metadata retrieval, policy request and bounded response reading. Cached ID tokens refresh at least sixty seconds before expiry. Metadata/policy errors fail closed with the existing generic admission-unavailable decision, without provider details or token logging.

The provider behavior follows the [GCS insert/precondition contract](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/json_api/v1/objects/insert) and [Cloud Run service-to-service authentication](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/authenticating/service-to-service). Local fixture tests are not live cloud acceptance evidence.

## HTTPS behind an operator-managed reverse proxy

A proxy that terminates TLS forwards HTTP to the runtime. For authenticated MCP access in that topology,
explicitly configure the runtime's [trusted proxy option](configuration.md#tls-terminating-reverse-proxy)
so it verifies the externally visible HTTPS resource audience. The default local Compose profile continues
to ignore forwarding headers and needs no change. Proxy trust does not weaken issuer, signature, expiry,
or tenant-audience checks, and it does not create or secure the reverse proxy itself.
